<h1 align="center">Wallet Frontend</h1>

> React web application that provides a user interface for the Wallet Service.

## Functional Components

- Add thor wallet address to the database
- View and delete extant Thor wallet records

## Running Locally

In order to run this application locally in a meaningful way, you will need to have all services running locally as well.  It is not advised to run this application locally while connected to the production services, as it increases the likelihood of making accidental changes to the production data.  

- To switch to the development URLs for the services, simply set development = true in src.service.BackendUrls.

- When first running this application, you will need to run "yarn install" to download all of the necessary dependencies.

- To launch the application, run "yarn start".  This should automatically open the application in a web page once it finishes launching.
